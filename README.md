# VRC2021-2022_CompetitionCode
Code and other files used by Team 44012A "SpaceVEX" in Vex Robotics Competitions.

NOTE (same note can be found in the header of src\main.cpp):
 * To get code to properly upload to the robot, you must first save the
 * entire project (File>Save All). Then open a command line (cmd.exe or
 * terminal) and run "prosv5 make all" without the quotes. Then return to PROS
 * and use the upload tool (PROS>Upload). The build tool in the Atom/PROS editor
 * is broken and does not remove the old build files, then uploads the unchanged
 * files to the robot which changes nothing.
