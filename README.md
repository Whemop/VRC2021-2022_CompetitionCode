# VRC2021-2022_CompetitionCode
Code and other files used by Team 44012A "SpaceVEX" in Vex Robotics Competitions.


NOTES
 - Uploading Code:
   * To get code to properly upload to the robot, you must first save the
   * entire project (File>Save All). Then open a command line (cmd.exe or
   * terminal) and run "prosv5 make all" without the quotes. Then return to PROS
   * and use the upload tool (PROS>Upload). The build tool in the Atom/PROS editor
   * is broken and does not remove the old build files, then uploads the unchanged
   * files to the robot which changes nothing.
- Uploading Code:
   * Code MUST be uploaded with a direct connection to VEX v5 Brain via USB.
